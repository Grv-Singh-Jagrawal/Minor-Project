In this Project, I made a machine Learning enabled Traffic Judgement system. Use of Weka tools, twython library, csv library are done. Front end is made using Google maps-api, Longdo api, Traffic Thailand api and HTML, Javascript, CSS. My goal was to compare real time traffic, in interval of 30 minutes against the Data we mapped according to weighted average of Tweets from Channels, users and Keywords search(traffic, stuck, jam, pahonyothin rd.). My target was Pahonyothin highway in Thailand it streches miles and is mostly crowded with vehicles. Moreover, people in Thailand are active social tweeters and Longdo helped us a lot in giving a great set of data with plentiful agility and parameters. At last, 2 maps were compared side by side and Their accurarcy was calculated, it was 97%. This project was inspired by a research paper we read from a university in south east asia. I hope this project adds up to a purpose.
